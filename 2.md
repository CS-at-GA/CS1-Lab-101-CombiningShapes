# A Quick P5 Overview (2/3)
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
  background(255);
}
```
The `function` keyword here is to denote that we are declaring a function (much like declariing a variable). You'll also observe some other syntactical oddities. After the identifier (`setup`), you will see parantheses. This is another indicator of a function. After that, you'll see an open curly bracket `{` which denotes the start of the _body_ of the function. That is, where it actually starts doing things. 

`setup` is a function that P5 is expecting. It runs once when the sketch starts[^1] and, as the name might suggest, we use this function to get ready for the main part of the program. 

In this case, we create a canvas that is the same dimensions as the window the sketch is running in. P5 is using the variables `windowWidth` and `windowHeight` to allow us to access that information. 

We then paint the background with a color given by a number. 255 means _white_. 

[^1]: it is actually a bit more complicated than that, but not in a useful way at the moment.
