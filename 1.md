# A Quick P5 Overview (1/3)

In this lab, you will explore [P5's shape functions](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape) as well as some other basic functionality. Quickly, however, a review of P5 basics by looking at the code from the default sketch.

```javascript
let colorlist = ['gold', 'yellow', 'turquoise', 'red']
```
This line **declares** a **variable** called `colorlist` and **assigns** to that variable a **list** (an array, technically, and denoted by square brackets `[]`) of **strings** that are also color names that P5 understands. That's a lot of terminology right out of the gate, but most of it should be straightforward. 

The `let` keyword is how we create a variable (followed by its _identifier_ or name). It would actually be more appropriate to use `const` in this case, since we have no plans on assigning something different to this variable during the running of the program. You may find JavaScript code out there making use of the `var` keyword. In general, you should use `let` instead of `var` for... reasons. 

The `=` in _most_ programming languages is how we assign a value to a variable. It is _not_ a check for equality. This will trip you up at some point.
