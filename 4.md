# Experimenting with the Basics. 

Given just this simple sketch, there is much that can be done in terms of experimenting. Here are three basic ways to experiment before moving on to advanced experimentation:

* experiment with [shapes](./5.md)
* experiment with [colors](./6.md)
* experiment with [`draw`](./7.md)
  
Do each of these experiments in whatever order you like, but do each of them before moving on to the [advanced portion](./8.md) of the lab.
