# Experiment with Shapes
Here is a link to the P5 documentation concerning [shapes](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Shape). You should become familiar with every function under the *2D Primitives* heading, except for `arc`[^1]. As the name suggests, these are your building blocks for creating more complex shapes. 

At a minimum, you should substitute out `ellipse` for each of the shapes. It is worth noting that some of the shapes require a different number of parameters (`quad` takes 8!).

* experiment with [shapes](./5.md)
* experiment with [colors](./6.md)
* experiment with [`draw`](./7.md)

Do each of these experiments in whatever order you like, but do each of them before moving on to the [advanced portion](./8.md) of the lab.

[^1]: `arc` requires the use of radians to determine where to start and stop the shape. This in turn requires you to know about the various radian-based constants (also located in the *Shapes* section of the P5 documentation). You can certainly use `arc`, but it is by far the most complex of the primitives. Honors students should familiarize themselves with `arc` and its usage.
