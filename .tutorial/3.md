# A Quick P5 Overview (3/3)
```javascript
function draw() {
  noStroke()
  fill(random(colorlist));
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 25, 25);
}
```
Like `setup`, P5 knows about the draw function, and this function executes continuously after setup is done running. 

`noStroke` is a function that turns off the outlining of a shape. 

`fill`, like `background` takes a color[^1] and all subsequent drawing will be filled in with that color[^2].

[`random`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/random) is a function that behaves differently based on the parameter it is given. In this case, it is given an array and so selects a random element from that array. That element (a string in this case) is then given to `fill`.  

Finally, we make a call to `ellipse`, which draws an ellipse on the canvas at the given position (the x and y coordinates of the mouse) and of a given width and height. _As soon as that ellipse is drawn_, `draw` is executed again. Perhaps as many as 60 times a second.  

[^1]:It actually can take a number, string, or a [p5.Color](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Color) object.
[^2]: or until another `fill` is called.
