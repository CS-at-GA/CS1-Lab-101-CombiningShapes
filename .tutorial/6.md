# Experiment with Colors
As we've already made note of, one can represent a color in a number of different ways. The most common being:

* numerically
* by its name as a string
* by its hexcode as a string

When I say _as a string_ I mean that the value has to be contained within a pair of double quotes `"`,single quotes `'`, or tick marks \`. So, if you wanted to use the hexcode for alice blue (`#F0F8FF`) as a color, you'd need to encapsulate it in one of those three delimeters. 

Here is a list of [140 color names](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp), a reading on [digital color](https://p5js.org/learn/color.html), and a link to my [favorite color tool](https://color.adobe.com/create). 

Using the following three functions, experiment with using different colors to make your drawings: `fill`, `background`, `stroke`.

* experiment with [shapes](./5.md)
* experiment with [colors](./6.md)
* experiment with [`draw`](./7.md)

Do each of these experiments in whatever order you like, but do each of them before moving on to the [advanced portion](./8.md) of the lab.
