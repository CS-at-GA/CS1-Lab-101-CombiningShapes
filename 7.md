# Experiment with draw

## Absolute positioning

Each of the 2D primitive functions takes at list one  position on the canvas from which to draw (shapes like `quad` or `triangle` take one point for each vertex). Thus far, you may have just been using the  `mouseX` and `mouseY` variables for some of the drawing, but it is worth noting that you can _absolutely position_ any of these shapes by deliberately specifiying points. 

Absolutely position a number of shapes. 

## Relative positioning

You can also come up with positions that are relative to other positions. 

Draw a series of shapes not _at_ the mouse, but _around_ the mouse using relative positioning. 

Draw a series of shapes relative to the boundaries of the canvas (recall that `0,0` is the upper-left corner of the canvas and that the width and height of the canvas are stored in the variables `width` and `height`)

## Repainting the background

Make sure at some point in your experimenting that you call `background` at the top of the `draw` function. 

## A Word of Warning

It should be noted that it is possible to position elements outside of the canvas using both absolute and relative positioning. Think about how this might happen.

* experiment with [shapes](./5.md)
* experiment with [colors](./6.md)
* experiment with [`draw`](./7.md)

Do each of these experiments in whatever order you like, but do each of them before moving on to the [advanced portion](./8.md) of the lab.
