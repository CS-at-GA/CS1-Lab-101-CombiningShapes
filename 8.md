# Advanced Experimenting

At this point, you should have a pretty good set of ~~tools~~ toys in the ~~toolbox~~ toybox. So now, let's play with them. 

## Goal #1 - Make a complex shape

Make a shape that is made up of multiple shapes. It should also be multiple colors. For now, you can position the shapes absolutely on the canvas. It helps to create a drawing of what you want _before_ you start coding it. 

## Goal #2 - Make that shape move

Recreate the shape but using relative (to the mouse) positioning. Hopefully you have that drawing around, so you can replace one of points on your shape with `mouseX` and `mouseY` and do some basic arithmatic to calculate all the other points. 

## Goal #3 - Create a punch-out shape

Make an _entirely new_ complex shape (absolute or relative positioning is fine), but make sure that it somehow includes a _hole_ or you are subtracting from a shape by using a shape that is the same color as the background color. 

## Goal #4 - Create a scene. 

Create a series of complex shapes that represents a scene. 

## Honors Students: 

You will display honors-level work here by creating a scene using sophisticated shapes made of many overlapping shapes, punch/cut-out techniques that are more graduated than simply the background, in a thoughtful color scheme, and mindful of the perils of absolute positioning.
